This topic describes how to use the MySQL proxy to monitor the health of your MySQL instance.

If you cannot write or connect to your app, you should
check the health status of your MySQL VMs. You can observe the health status of MySQL VMs through a proxy 
using the Switchboard dashboard or API endpoint. You can also view the number of client connections 
routed through a proxy to each VM.
